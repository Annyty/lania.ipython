IPython Notebooks and the Python Scienctific Stack
---

[IPython](http://ipython.org/) in action creating reproducible and publishable interactive work.

What is this?
------

This repo contains the full [talk](http://za.pycon.org/talks/10/) I indend to deliver (have delivered) at [PyConZA2013](http://za.pycon.org/). It contains all the files needed to build a final publishable PDF document and even adds a customer front page.

[The Complete Talk GitHub Website can be accessed here][6]

Background
-------------
IPython had become a popular choice for doing interactive scientific work. It extends the standard Python interpreter and adds many usefull new futures. There is realy no need to use the standard Python interpreter anymore.
In addition to this IPython offers a web based Notebook that makes interactive work much easier,and have been used to write repeatable science papers and more recently a book has been published using this platform, the online Notebook Viewer and GitHub. The development of this material and toolchain to compile the notebook to a publishable PDF has inspired me to maybe even try and turn this into a full book. Lets see what happens.

Combining the most common scientific packages with IPython makes it a formidable tool and serious competition to R. ( _R is still awesome!_ )

As a matter of fact you can run R in the notebook session, embed YouTube Videos, Images and lots more but let me not get ahead of myself....

The science stack consists of (but not limited to):

package  |  description
---  |  ---
[pandas][1]  |  `dataframe` implementation (based on numpy)
[scipy][2]  |  efficient numerical routines
[sympy][3]  |  `symbolic mathematics`
[matplotlib][4]  |  python standard `plotting` package
[sci-kit learn][5] | machine learning and `well documented!`

Talk contents
--------
The talk will aim to introduce these tools and give some practical examples. Once completed it will be shown how easy it is to publish your work to various formats. Some of the topics covered in the talk are lister below:

item   | description
---- |  -------
ipython | quick intro to ipython and the notebook
setup  | set up your environment / get the talk files
notebook basics | navigate the notebook
notebook magics | special notebook commands that can be very usefull
getting input   | as from IPython 1.00 getting input from sdtin is possible
local files | how to link to local files in the notebook directory
plotting	| how to create beautifull inline plots
symbolic math | quick demo of sympy model
pandas  | quick intro to pandas dataframe
typsetting | include markdown, Latex via MathJax
loading code | how to load a remote .py code file
gist         | paste some of your work to gist for sharing
js		| some javascript examples
customising | loading a customer css and custom matplotlib config file
git cell    | add code to a special cell that would commit to git
output formats | how to publish your work to html, pdf or jeveal.js presentation

[IPython pdf book](https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/finaldoc.pdf?raw=true)  | converted to pdf and frontpage stitched to it)
[Ipython reveal.js presentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/pycon13_ipython.slides.html#/) | converted to a reveal.js presenation and served online

Dependancies
-------------
I was given the challenge to develop all of this on a Windows machine as some of my sponser want to demostrate that this stuff can not only be done on Linuz/OSX. So all the toolchains are Windows based. If you know Linux, then you are the type of person that would easily port this.

package  |  description
-------- | ------------
pandoc 	 | The document converter used by IPython
MikeTex  | If you want to do a TEX to PDF transform. I had so many issues so settled for wkhtmltopdf(below) to convert HTML to PDF rather. 
wkhtmltopdf  | Convert HTML to PDF
pdftk   |  Can be used to combine PDF's. IN this case add a frontpage to the generated IPython notebook PDF.
