IPython Notebook and the Python Scientific Stack
---------------------------------------------
(This is still the talk proposal)

> **IPython in action creating reproducible and publishable interactive work.**

Description
-------------
IPython had become a popular choice for doing interactive scientific work. 
In addition to this IPython offers a web based Notebook that makes interactive work much easier.
Notebooks have been used to write repeatable science papers and more recently a book has been published using this platform, the online Notebook Viewer and GitHub.

Combining the most common science packages with IPython makes it a formidable tool and serious competition to R. ( _R is still awesome!_ )

As a matter of fact you can run R in the notebook session, embed YouTube Videos, Images and lots more.

The science stack consists of:

* pandas -		dataframe implementation (based on numpy)

* scipy	-		efficient numerical routines

* simpy	-		symbolic mathematics

* matplotlib -	plotting

* sci-kit learn -		machine learning


The talk will aim to introduce these tools and give some practical examples. Once completed it will be shown how easy it is to publish the work done to 
* html
* pdf
* or even a full presentation
