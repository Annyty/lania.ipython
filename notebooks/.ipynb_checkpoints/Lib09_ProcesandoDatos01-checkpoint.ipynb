      "The reason is that `print` is a built-in Python function and formats the dictionary the only way it knows - the simple ugly way. By the time IPython Notebook sees the dictionary contents it's already formatted as a string. Whereas `count` is still a dictionary, so IPython Notebook can apply smarts to format it in a better way.\n",
