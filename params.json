( _R is still awesome!_ )\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact you can run R in the notebook session, embed YouTube Videos, Images and lots more.\r\n\r\nThe science stack consists of:\r\n\r\n* [pandas][1] \t-\t\tdataframe implementation (based on numpy)\r\n\r\n* [scipy][2]\t-\t\tefficient numerical routines\r\n\r\n* [sympy][3]\t-\t\tsymbolic mathematics\r\n\r\n* [matplotlib][4] -\tplotting\r\n\r\n* [sci-kit learn][5] -\t\tmachine learning\r\n\r\n\r\nThe talk will aim to introduce these tools and give some practical examples. Once completed it will be shown how easy it is to publish the work done to \r\n* html\r\n* pdf\r\n* or even a full presentation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Complete Talk GitHub Repo can be found here][6]\r\n\r\nSome interesting links\r\n-----------------------\r\n* [A book written with IPython Notebook][7]\r\n* [Notebook Viewer][8]\r\n* [Installing almost everything you need][9]\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n----------\r\n* I am an Electrical Engineer and is currently working for a [consulting firm][10] where I manage the Business Analytics and Quantitative Decision Support Services division.\r\n* I use python in my day to day work as a practical alternative to the limitations of EXCEL in using large data sets.\r\n* [LinkedIn][11]\r\n* I am also a co-founder at [House4Hack][12]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://pandas.pydata.org/\r\n  [2]: http://www.scipy.org/\r\n  [3]: http://sympy.org/en/index.html\r\n  [4]: http://matplotlib.org/\r\n  [5]: http://scikit-learn.org/\r\n  [6]: https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/\r\n  [7]: http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/\r\n  [8]: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/\r\n  [9]: http://www.continuum.io/downloads\r\n  [10]: http://www.eon.co.za/index.php/our-services-main/our-services/business-analytics\r\n  [11]: http://www.linkedin.com/in/tobienortje\r\n  [12]: House4Hack%5D%28http://www.house4hack.co.za/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
